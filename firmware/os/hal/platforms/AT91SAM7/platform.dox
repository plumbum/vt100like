 * @brief AT91SAM7 specific support.
 * @details The AT91SAM7 support includes:
 * - Buffered, interrupt driven, serial driver.
 * - EMAC driver with MII support.
 * - A demo supporting the kernel test suite.
 * - A Web server demo using the uIP TCP/IP stack.
 * - A Web server demo using the lwIP TCP/IP stack.

/**
 * @defgroup AT91SAM7_PAL AT91SAM7 I/O Ports Support
 * @brief I/O Ports peripherals support.
 * @details This module supports the AT91SAM7 PIO controller. The controller
 * supports the following features (see @ref PAL):
 * - 32 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset functions.
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * <h2>Supported Setup Modes</h2>
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_UNCONNECTED.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT_ANALOG (same as @p PAL_MODE_INPUT).
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT_PULLUP.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN.
 * .
 * Any attempt to setup an invalid mode is ignored.
 *
 * <h2>Suboptimal Behavior</h2>
 * Some PIO features are less than optimal:
 * - Pad/port toggling operations are not atomic.
 * - Pad/group mode setup is not atomic.
