 * @defgroup STM8_PAL STM8 I/O Ports Support
 * @brief I/O Ports peripherals support.
 * @details This module supports the STM8 GPIO controller. The controller
 * supports the following features (see @ref PAL):
 * - 8 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset/toggle functions because special STM8 instruction set.
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * <h2>Supported Setup Modes</h2>
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_UNCONNECTED.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT_PULLUP.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN.
 * .
 * Any attempt to setup an invalid mode is ignored.
 *
 * <h2>Suboptimal Behavior</h2>
 * Some STM8 I/O ports features are less than optimal:
 * - Bus/group writing is not atomic.
 * - Pad/group mode setup is not atomic.
