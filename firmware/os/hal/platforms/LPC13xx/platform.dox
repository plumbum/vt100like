 * @defgroup LPC13xx LPC13xx Support
 * @brief LPC13xx specific support.
 * @details The LPC13xx support includes:
 * - I/O ports driver.
 * - Buffered, interrupt driven, serial driver.
 * - A demo supporting the kernel test suite.
 * .
 * @ingroup ARMCMx

/**
 * @defgroup LPC13xx_PAL LPC13xx I/O Ports Support
 * @brief I/O Ports peripherals support.
 * @details This module supports the LPC13xx GPIO controller. The controller
 * supports the following features (see @ref PAL):
 * - 12 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset functions.
 * - Atomic set+reset function (atomic bus operations).
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * <h2>Supported Setup Modes</h2>
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_UNCONNECTED.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL.
 * .
 * Any attempt to setup an invalid mode is ignored.
 *
 * <h2>Suboptimal Behavior</h2>
 * Some GPIO features are less than optimal:
 * - Pad/port toggling operations are not atomic.
 * - Pull-up and Pull-down resistors cannot be programmed through the PAL
 *   driver and must be programmed separately.
 * - Reading of the output latch for pads programmed as input is not possible,
 *   the input pin value is returned instead.
 * .
