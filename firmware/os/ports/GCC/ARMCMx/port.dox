 * @defgroup ARMCMx ARM Cortex-Mx
 * @details This port supports the ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M architectures (all the
 * Cortex-Mx cores).
 *
 * @section ARMCMx_STATES_A System logical states in ARMv6-M
 * - <b>Init</b>. This state is represented by the startup code and the
 *   initialization code before @p chSysInit() is executed. It has not a
 *   special hardware state associated.
 * - <b>Normal</b>. This is the state the system has after executing
 *   @p chSysInit(). In this state interrupts are enabled. The processor
 *   is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Suspended</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are globally
 *   disabled. The processor is running in thread-privileged mode. In this
 *   mode this state is not different from the <b>Disabled</b> state.
 * - <b>Disabled</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are globally
 *   disabled. The processor is running in thread-privileged mode. In this
 *   mode this state is not different from the <b>Suspended</b> state.
 * - <b>Sleep</b>. This state is entered with the execution of the specific
 *   instruction @p <b>wfi</b>.
 * - <b>S-Locked</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are globally
 *   disabled. The processor is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>I-Locked</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are globally
 *   disabled. The processor is running in exception-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Serving Regular Interrupt</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are
 *   not globally masked but only interrupts with higher priority can preempt
 *   the current handler. The processor is running in exception-privileged
 *   mode.
 * - <b>Serving Fast Interrupt</b>. This state is not implemented in the
 *   ARMv6-M implementation.
 * - <b>Serving Non-Maskable Interrupt</b>. The Cortex-M3 has a specific
 *   asynchronous NMI vector and several synchronous fault vectors that can
 *   be considered belonging to this category.
 * - <b>Halted</b>. Implemented as an infinite loop after globally masking all
 *   the maskable interrupt sources. The ARM state is whatever the processor
 *   was running when @p chSysHalt() was invoked.
 *
 * @section ARMCMx_STATES_B System logical states in ARMv7-M
 * The ChibiOS/RT logical @ref system_states are mapped as follow in the ARM
 * Cortex-M3 port:
 * - <b>Init</b>. This state is represented by the startup code and the
 *   initialization code before @p chSysInit() is executed. It has not a
 *   special hardware state associated.
 * - <b>Normal</b>. This is the state the system has after executing
 *   @p chSysInit(). In this state the ARM Cortex-M3 has the BASEPRI register
 *   set at @p CORTEX_BASEPRI_USER level, interrupts are not masked. The
 *   processor is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Suspended</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are not globally
 *   masked but the BASEPRI register is set to @p CORTEX_BASEPRI_KERNEL thus
 *   masking any interrupt source with lower or equal priority. The processor
 *   is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Disabled</b>. Interrupt sources are globally masked. The processor
 *   is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Sleep</b>. This state is entered with the execution of the specific
 *   instruction @p <b>wfi</b>.
 * - <b>S-Locked</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are not globally
 *   masked but the BASEPRI register is set to @p CORTEX_BASEPRI_KERNEL thus
 *   masking any interrupt source with lower or equal priority. The processor
 *   is running in thread-privileged mode.
 * - <b>I-Locked</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are not globally
 *   masked but the BASEPRI register is set to @p CORTEX_BASEPRI_KERNEL thus
 *   masking any interrupt source with lower or equal priority. The processor
 *   is running in exception-privileged mode.
 * - <b>Serving Regular Interrupt</b>. In this state the interrupt sources are
 *   not globally masked but only interrupts with higher priority can preempt
 *   the current handler. The processor is running in exception-privileged
 *   mode.
 * - <b>Serving Fast Interrupt</b>. It is basically the same of the SRI state
 *   but it is not possible to switch to the I-Locked state because fast
 *   interrupts can preempt the kernel critical zone.
 * - <b>Serving Non-Maskable Interrupt</b>. The Cortex-M3 has a specific
 *   asynchronous NMI vector and several synchronous fault vectors that can
 *   be considered belonging to this category.
 * - <b>Halted</b>. Implemented as an infinite loop after globally masking all
 *   the maskable interrupt sources. The ARM state is whatever the processor
 *   was running when @p chSysHalt() was invoked.
 * .
 * @section ARMCMx_NOTES The ARM Cortex-Mx port notes
 * The ARM Cortex-Mx port is organized as follow:
 * - The @p main() function is invoked in thread-privileged mode.
 * - Each thread has a private process stack, the system has a single main
 *   stack where all the interrupts and exceptions are processed.
 * - The threads are started in thread-privileged mode.
 * - Interrupt nesting and the other advanced core/NVIC features are supported.

 * @defgroup ARMCMx_CONF Configuration Options
 * @brief ARM Cortex-Mx Configuration Options.
 * @details The ARMCMx port allows some architecture-specific configurations
 * settings that can be overridden by redefining them in @p chconf.h.
 * Usually there is no need to change the default values.
 * - @p INT_REQUIRED_STACK, this value represent the amount of stack space used
 *   by an interrupt handler between the @p extctx and @p intctx
 *   structures.<br>
 *   In the current implementation this value is guaranteed to be zero so
 *   there is no need to modify this value unless changes are done at the
 *   interrupts handling code.
 * - @p IDLE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE, stack area size to be assigned to the IDLE
 *   thread. Usually there is no need to change this value unless inserting
 *   code in the IDLE thread hook macro.
 * - @p CORTEX_BASEPRI_KERNEL, this is the @p BASEPRI value for the kernel lock
 *   code. Code running at higher priority levels must not invoke any OS API.
 *   This setting is specific to the ARMv7-M architecture.
 * - @p CORTEX_PRIORITY_SYSTICK, priority of the SYSTICK handler.
 * - @p CORTEX_PRIORITY_SVCALL, priority of the SVCALL handler.
 * - @p CORTEX_PRIORITY_PENDSV, priority of the PENDSV handler.
 * - @p CORTEX_ENABLE_WFI_IDLE, if set to @p TRUE enables the use of the
 *   @p <b>wfi</b> instruction from within the idle loop. This is defaulted to
 *   FALSE because it can create problems with some debuggers. Setting this
 *   option to TRUE reduces the system power requirements.

/**
 * @defgroup ARMCMx_STARTUP Startup Support
 * @brief ARM Cortex-Mx startup code support.
 * @details ChibiOS/RT provides its own generic startup file for the ARM
 * Cortex-Mx port.
 * Of course it is not mandatory to use it but care should be taken about the
 * startup phase details.
 *
 * <h2>Startup Process</h2>
 * The startup process, as implemented, is the following:
 * -# Interrupts are masked globally.
 * -# The two stacks are initialized by assigning them the sizes defined in the
 *    linker script (usually named @p ch.ld). Stack areas are allocated from
 *    the highest RAM location downward.
 * -# An early initialization routine @p hwinit0 is invoked, if the symbol is
 *    not defined then an empty default routine is executed (weak symbol).
 * -# DATA and BSS segments are initialized.
 * -# The CPU state is switched to Privileged and the PSP stack is used.
 * -# A late initialization routine @p hwinit1 is invoked, if the symbol not
 *    defined then an empty default routine is executed (weak symbol).<br>
 *    This late initialization function is also the proper place for a
 *    @a bootloader, if your application requires one.
 * -# The @p main() function is invoked with the parameters @p argc and @p argv
 *    set to zero.
 * -# Should the @p main() function return a branch is performed to the weak
 *    symbol MainExitHandler. The default code is an endless empty loop.
 * .
 * <h2>Expected linker symbols</h2>
 * The startup code starts at the symbol @p ResetHandler and expects the
 * following symbols to be defined in the linker script:
 * - @p __ram_end__ RAM end location +1.
 * - @p __main_stack_size__ Exception stack size.
 * - @p __process_stack_size__ Process stack size. This is the stack area used
 *      by the @p main() function.
 * - @p _textdata address of the data segment source read only data.
 * - @p _data data segment start location.
 * - @p _edata data segment end location +1.
 * - @p _bss_start BSS start location.
 * - @p _bss_end BSS end location +1.
